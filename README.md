## Design

### Color palette

The choice of colors for the website was carefully planned, with shades of purple and lilac being selected for their association with spirituality, intuition, and calmness. These colors were chosen to create a pleasant and engaging atmosphere for users, conveying a sense of serenity and sophistication while reflecting the brand's identity and value proposition. Additionally, the strategic use of contrast was taken into account to facilitate website navigation and readability, ensuring a more intuitive and accessible experience for all visitors.

### Typography 

Google Fonts was utilized to incorporate the selected font styles into the website. 

I selected 'Montserrat Alternates' for the body text due to its clean and contemporary appearance, enhancing readability across various content sections. As for the logo, I chose 'Mystery Quest' to evoke a sense of mystery and intrigue, aligning with the mystical theme of the website while adding a unique touch to the brand identity.

### Imagery 

The selected images for the website aim to immerse users in the realm of consultations offered by the consultants. I ensured they were of good resolution, seamlessly integrating with the colors and theme of the site. The goal was to provide a visually engaging and cohesive experience, connecting users to the spiritual environment of the consultations while facilitating understanding of the services available for booking through the platform.
