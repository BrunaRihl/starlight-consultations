## Design

### Color palette

A color palette was selected, consisting of shades of gray, white, black, and blue, to capture the atmosphere of a starry sky and convey the sensation of contemplating constellations. The tones were chosen with the purpose of reflecting the beauty and serenity of the night sky. The contrast between soft colors and darker tones not only recreated the shimmering effect of a starry sky but also contributed to creating a pleasant visual experience, aiding in reading and navigation on the website.

![ZodiacPairs website color palette](/assets/images/docs/palette.png)  

### Typography 

Google Fonts was utilized to incorporate the selected font styles into the website. 

I chose the fonts 'Courier Prime' and 'Space Mono' for the website. 'Courier Prime' was selected for titles and subtitles due to its monospaced formatting, which brings a sense of order and uniformity. On the other hand, 'Space Mono', also monospaced, features a modern and futuristic style, aligning with the theme of constellations. Both fonts were chosen for their high readability, essential for presenting information accurately and accessibly. Their technical and futuristic styles seamlessly integrate with the theme of space and astrology.

![ZodiacPairs fonts choosen](/assets/images/docs/fonts.png)  

### Imagery 

The selected images for the website aim to immerse users in the world of zodiac constellations. I made sure they were high-resolution, seamlessly blending with the colors and theme of the game. This includes a custom logo image and background visuals for the memory game cards. The goal was to provide an aesthetically cohesive and visually stimulating experience, ensuring that users feel connected to the celestial theme while engaging with the game.

### Wireframes

I developed a simple wireframe in PowerPoint for the game, aiming to ensure a consistent experience across mobile devices, computers, and tablets. I adjusted the size of buttons, texts, and cards, while maintaining the same layout for all cases.

I made some adjustments in relation to what I had planned for positioning and added some buttons to enhance functionality and user experience, aiming to ensure the game is accessible and enjoyable on any platform.

# Features

The game website consists of only one initial page that starts with a header, buttons to access information about the game rules and the zodiac constellations, play and replay buttons, as well as a game stats bar that is activated only when the player presses the "play" button. At this point, the game board with the cards is displayed. Additionally, there are three modal windows: one for the rules, another for game information, and a final one that is displayed when the game concludes.


## Background

High-resolution images, harmonizing with the game's theme, were chosen for the backgrounds. Tailored for an array of screen sizes, be it the expansive displays of computers or the more compact screens of smartphones and tablets, each image was curated to fit seamlessly. This approach was employed to elevate the visual experience, regardless of the device in use.

![ZodiacPairs backgrownd images - image hero](/assets/images/docs/sizes-bg.png)

### Favicon

The favicon has been added with the game logo in the browser tab.

![ZodiacPairs backgrownd images - image hero](/assets/images/docs/favicon-zp.png)

## Sections

### Header

In the header, there is a custom-designed logo created specifically for the game, accompanied by an inviting phrase encouraging users to play.

![ZodiacPairs header](/assets/images/docs/header.png)

### Informational Buttons

Below the header, users will find there are two informational buttons. 
  
![ZodiacPairs info buttons](/assets/images/docs/info-btns.png)

When clicked, one opens a modal window explaining the rules and scoring of the game, while the other provides a brief explanation about the zodiac sign constellations.

#### How to play:

### Play and Restart Buttons

* Following that, we have the 'Play' and 'Replay' buttons section. 
* The 'Play' button has been prominently styled to emphasize its role as the central starting point for the user experience

![ZodiacPairs info buttons](/assets/images/docs/play-btns.png)

### Game board:

* The game board is designed to display only when the player presses the 'Play' or 'Replay' buttons. 
* For the memory card game, images of zodiac constellations were used. 
* A custom back card with the game's name was created. 
* When the player matches the corresponding pairs of constellations, the name of the zodiac sign to which the constellation belongs is revealed.

![ZodiacPairs game board cards back](/assets/images/docs/cards-back.png)

![ZodiacPairs game board cards](/assets/images/docs/cards.png)

### Final Game Modal Window:

At the end of the game, a modal window is displayed, informing whether the player has won or lost, as well as presenting the final score, the number of moves required to find the card pairs, and the elapsed time.

![ZodiacPairs final game win](/assets/images/docs/win.png)

![ZodiacPairs final game lose](/assets/images/docs/lose.png)

## Features and resources to be added in the future

* Implement a ranking system to save the best scores of players.
* Create an option for users to change the cards with other images related to the zodiac theme.
* Add a level option to the game: easy, medium, and hard.

## Accessibility 

From the project's inception, the game website's design was planned with a focus on accessibility. Special attention was given to ensure there was adequate color contrast, an easily comprehensible structure, and intuitive navigation. Additionally, practices of semantic HTML were implemented, establishing a robust foundation for the user experience.

### LightHouse 

The accessibility, performance, best practices, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of the website were analyzed using the LightHouse tool available in Google Chrome's DevTools.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

* Backgrownd image

During the project development, I encountered challenges while trying to set up a background image that would cover the entire page. The solution was to apply certain settings for the image directly to the < html > element instead of the < body >. This allowed the image to effectively fill the entire page, regardless of the browser's size.

![Solved bug - background image](/assets/images/docs/background-solved.png)

* Reset game

While working on the game development, I encountered an issue where the game status wasn't resetting properly upon finishing a match and requesting to play again. After some attempts, I realized that in addition to resetting the variable values to zero within the restartGame() function, it was also necessary to utilize the innerText property by adding the '0'(zero). This property proved to be crucial in directly inserting the zeroed values into the interface every time the game was restarted.

![Solved bug - reset stats](/assets/images/docs/reset-solved.png)  


* Adapting Content for Small Screens

Despite using the Flexbox model for the game website development, I noticed a scrolling issue where the game was not adapting ideally to smaller mobile screens. To address this, I utilized Google Developer Tools to systematically remove elements one by one. This allowed me to pinpoint that the logo was causing this problem due to its size. As a solution, I added a smaller fixed size for it in the media queries, which effectively resolved the issue.

#### Unsolved Bugs

No unfixed bugs on the website.
